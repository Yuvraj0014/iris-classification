# iris-classification
## Using streamlit
## Overview
This repository contains a basic machine learning project that uses Streamlit to build a web app for classifying different species of iris flowers. The app relies on a Random Forest Classifier model, which is trained on the popular Iris dataset. The model predicts the species of an iris flower based on measurements of the flower's sepal and petal lengths and widths.
## Requirements
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
